# Inventory-Management-System
Overview:-

 I have Created a command-line inventory management system that uses SQLite for data storage.

Requirements:-

Python (3.x)

SQLite3 (Python module)

For Database :-

The program uses SQLite to create a database file (database.db) and a table (products) to store product information.

The add_product function allows the user to add a product to the inventory.

The display_inventory function retrieves and prints the current inventory.

The main function provides a simple command-line menu for the user to interact with the system.
